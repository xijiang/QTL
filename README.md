# QTL

This is a collection of (small) test data, algorithms and functions about 
breeding and genetics.  They are from many of my repos, mainly on GitHub.
These datawere used many times, and hence majorly confirmd.

They are grouped in the following sections:
- `Data`, majorly for test purpose.
- `Simulation`, to simulate various scenarios in breeding
- `Matrices`, matrix manipulation algorithms
- `Notes`, including some standard procedures
- to be continued
