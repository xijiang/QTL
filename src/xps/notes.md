# Notes
This folder contains some example pipelines that I used.

Each of the files in this directory was once tested for some purpose.
The function they called may not work any more.
One simple solution is to reverse the commit to the period when the file was last modified.

Each file was written in a branch. This is to avoid too many test commits.
